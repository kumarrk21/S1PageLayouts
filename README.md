Mobile only Page Layouts (View Only)
===============================
This component can be used to create mobile specific record detail pages, dynamically. Salesforce1 mobile doesn't support mobile specific page layouts (yet). So, if you have a lot of fields in your object, it becomes diffcult for the user to view the most required information in a single glance. Quick actions work great in providing mobile specific page layouts but is supported only for record create or edit.

This component allows to dynamically display key fields of a record in Salesforce1 app through either a quick action or URL field. Please read this blog for more information on how to use this component in your org.

Click on the 'Deploy to Salesforce' button to deploy this in your Sandbox org.
